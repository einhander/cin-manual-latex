\nomenclature{\textbf{Audio offset}}{audio displacement applied to the playback position to synchronize playback with other tracks.}

\nomenclature{\textbf{Automatic keyframes}}{every time you tweak a key-framable parameter it “automatically” creates a keyframe on the timeline.

Enable automatic keyframe mode by enabling the automatic keyframe toggle on the timeline editpanel.}

There are many other operations that can be done.}

\nomenclature{\textbf{Deinterlace}}{the process of converting interlaced video (a sequence of fields) into a non-interlaced form (a sequence of frames).  Deinterlacing downsamples/blends the refreshes that reconstruct images with the least motion damage.  See the definition of Interlace for an explanation of interlacing.}

\nomenclature{\textbf{Image list}}{a text file with a specific format containing a list of absolute paths for the still images of a sequence plus additional information like file format, framerate and image resolution. Image lists are human readable and editable. Once loaded in the timeline, image lists behave like a video clip. In Cinelerra they can be used to load multiple images belonging to the same scene as a single video asset. Cinelerra can render video clips to image lists (a text file + multiple still images).}

\nomenclature{\textbf{I-beam mode}}{formally known as Cut and Paste editing mode where a lot of the operations performed on your video are with various copy commands.  See Cut and Paste editing definition.}

Index files are not human readable.  If an index file for an asset is already built, it is not recreated – this saves a lot of time. However if you switch from a native format to using ffmpeg, or vice versa, you should always rebuild the index. The number of index files to keep can be set by the user and you can easily delete all of them at once from the Settings$\rightarrow$Preferences, Interface menu.}

\nomenclature{\textbf{Insertion point}}{a flashing hairline mark that vertically spans the timeline. It marks the starting place of the next operation to be performed.}

\nomenclature{\textbf{Interlace}}{(extended definition included here because it is no longer a commonly used technique). Originally media was conditioned for presentation on a cathode ray tube (CRT), like an old-fashioned television set.  The image sample was scanned using an image orthicon tube and vacuum tube oscillators. The result is very imprecise and too slow for the human eye.  Interlacing, which is scanning the image by fields, first all the even and then all the odd lines, uses phosphor persistence to create a smooth presentation effect and reduce the required signal bandwidth.  Today we use a progressive scan at a higher framerate to avoid these issues.}

\nomenclature{\textbf{Interpolation}}{a method of inventing data using keyframe way points on a curve.  The shape of the curve represents the type of the interpolation, for example piecewise linear or bezier. In Cinelerra interpolation is the process that inserts many new values in between the user defined keyframes to give a smoother result.}

Lossy compression is most commonly used to compress multimedia (audio, video, still images), especially for streaming. Repeatedly compressing and decompressing the file will cause, for most lossy compression formats, to progressively lose quality. MP3 is an example.}

\nomenclature{\textbf{Luma/Luminance}}{Luma represents the achromatic image without any color (like a black and white picture), the part of a video signal that includes information about its brightness.

\nomenclature{\textbf{YUV}}{is a color model which splits luma from chroma, similarly to human sight.. Colors are stored as absolute luma representation and the difference signal between luma and chroma complement components.  This color model is used by PAL and NTSC standards. Y stands for the luma component and U and V are the chroma components. U and V are actually color difference components (respectively R-Y and B-Y). In fact YUV signals are created from an original RGB source. The weighted values of R, G, and B are added together to produce a single Y signal, representing the overall luma. The U signal is then created by subtracting the Y from the blue signal of the original RGB, and then scaling; V is created by subtracting the Y from the red, and then scaling by a different factor. Previous black-and-white systems used only luma (Y) information and color information (U and V) was added so that a black-and-white receiver would still be able to display a color picture as a normal black and white picture.}
